![Git workflow diagram showing local and remote repositories with four main sections: Working Directory (green folder icon), Index (orange checklist icon), .git Directory (red database icon), and GitHub (black Octocat icon). Arrows labeled with git commands show the flow: clone from GitHub to local repo, add from Working Directory to Index, commit from Index to .git Directory, commit -a directly from Working Directory to .git Directory, checkout from .git Directory back to Working Directory, and push from .git Directory to GitHub. The diagram illustrates the complete cycle of version control operations in a single-user git workflow.](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/Courses/CS7ARCH/assets/img/git/git_singleuserflow.png)
